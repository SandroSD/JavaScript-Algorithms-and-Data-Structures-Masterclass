# Intermediate Sorting Algorithms

## Objectives

- Understand the limitations of the sorting algorithms we've learned so far
- Implement merge sort
- Implement quick sort
- Implement radix sort

## Faster Sorts

- There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from **O(N<sup>2</sup>)** to **O(N logN)**
- There's a tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity
- The more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
